# dev-skills

A **GitHub Copilot CLI plugin marketplace** — a curated collection of developer-productivity
skills you can install into Copilot CLI to guide, analyze, and accelerate your engineering work.

Each plugin bundles one or more **skills** (reusable prompts/workflows Copilot loads on demand).
This repository is the marketplace: its [`.github/plugin/marketplace.json`](.github/plugin/marketplace.json)
indexes every plugin so Copilot CLI can discover and install them.

## 📚 Skill Index

| Skill | Plugin | What it does |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| [**codev**](plugins/codev) | `codev` | Guides a coding task end-to-end through a four-stage workflow — **Understand → Plan → Implement → Review** — with explicit gates between stages. |
| [**deep-analysis**](plugins/deep-analysis) | `deep-analysis` | Performs a deep codebase/architecture analysis from a prompt and produces a polished, self-contained **HTML report** of the findings. |

### codev — Guided Development Workflow

A lightweight conductor that takes a rough task brief all the way to a reviewed implementation:

1. **Understand** — restates the brief, explores the code, and asks focused clarifying questions
   until requirements are agreed. Sets up a dedicated feature branch first.
2. **Plan** — hands the refined requirements to the CLI's built-in plan mode (`/plan`).
3. **Implement** — executes the approved plan with surgical changes and the smallest targeted
   build/test validation, then reports requirements-vs-implemented.
4. **Review** — runs the built-in `/review` on the changes and helps address findings.

It announces each stage and won't advance without a gate check. It never creates/merges PRs or
deploys, and it only pushes to a remote after explicit human confirmation.
**Invoke:** `/codev <brief>`, "start a dev task", "guide me through this feature end to end".

### deep-analysis — Analysis & HTML Report

Understands your prompt, performs an extensive multi-faceted analysis (architecture, code quality,
dependencies, and — on request — a recommended implementation approach), asks clarifying questions
when the request is ambiguous, and generates a **light-theme, self-contained HTML report** grounded
in real files and code, then opens it in your browser.
**Invoke:** "analyze the auth flow in the payments service", "architecture review of this repo",
"produce an HTML report of the dependency graph".

## 🚀 Install as a Marketplace

Copilot CLI installs plugins from marketplaces — GitHub repositories containing a
`marketplace.json` catalog. Add this repository once, then install any plugin from it.

> All commands work both from your shell (`copilot plugin ...`) and inside an interactive Copilot
> CLI session (`/plugin ...`).

**1. Register the marketplace:**

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add cottonstartiet/dev-skills
```

**2. Browse what's available:**

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace browse dev-skills
```

**3. Install a plugin** (`<plugin>@<marketplace>`):

```bash
copilot plugin install codev@dev-skills
copilot plugin install deep-analysis@dev-skills
```

**4. Verify it loaded** — start Copilot CLI and run `/env` (or `copilot plugin list`) to confirm
the plugin's skills are available. You can then trigger a skill by its phrases, e.g. `/codev`.

### Install without registering the marketplace

You can install a single plugin straight from this repo's subdirectory:

```bash
copilot plugin install cottonstartiet/dev-skills:plugins/codev
copilot plugin install cottonstartiet/dev-skills:plugins/deep-analysis
```

### Try a plugin locally (development)

Point Copilot CLI at a plugin directory without installing it:

```bash
copilot --plugin-dir ./plugins/codev
```

```

- **`.github/plugin/marketplace.json`** declares the marketplace `name` (`dev-skills`) and lists
  each plugin with its `source`, `version`, and `description`.
- Each **plugin** folder under `plugins/` has a `plugin.json` manifest (declaring its `skills`
  and/or `agents`), a `README.md`, and its skill content under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- **`raw/`** holds imported skills that have not yet been packaged into plugins.

---

## ➕ Adding a New Plugin

1. Create `plugins/<name>/` containing:
   - `plugin.json` — `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `license`, `keywords`, and
     `"skills": ["skills/"]` (and/or `"agents": "agents/"`).
   - `README.md` — what the plugin does and how to invoke it.
   - `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — the skill, with YAML front matter (`name`, `description`) and the
     workflow body. Keep it **repo-agnostic** so it works in any consuming repository.
2. Add an entry for the plugin to the `plugins` array in
   [`.github/plugin/marketplace.json`](.github/plugin/marketplace.json).
3. Add a row to the **Skill Index** above.
4. Validate that all manifests are valid JSON and that each plugin `source` path resolves.
